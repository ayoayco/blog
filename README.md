This is the repo for [ayos.blog](https://ayos.blog), which is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and heavily modified styling on top of the default [Minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).

I add ideas, outline, or drafts as [github issues](https://github.com/ayoayco/blog/issues) first. You can file an issue too if you want to request a topic or get in touch about anything on the blog.

## How to Set Up the Project

1. follow the [jekyll installation guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation) for your machine

2. clone project, then go to the directory:
```
git clone git@github.com:ayoayco/blog
cd blog
```

3. install dependencies:
```
bundle install
```

4. run dev server:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

5. build project:
```
bundle exec jekyll build
```
