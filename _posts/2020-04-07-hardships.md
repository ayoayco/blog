If the goal for our existence on this earth is to [love](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+13%3A34-35&version=NASB), then maybe all of our hardships' purpose is for us to learn empathy.<!--more-->

We have been in lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic for more than two weeks now.

It has affected people in different ways--from something simple such as being bored to more extreme such as being on the brink of insanity or death due to hunger.

I know you might have heard this said: "The same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg. It's not about the circumstance, but what you are made of."

This could have worked well in some other set up, but in the situation we have now, this is far from inspiring.

The lockdown and call for social distancing has shown us a more grave matter: that there has been a huge SOCIAL GAP among our people, and this is killing people.

Poor people are not made of weaker materials than the rest.

We can never tell them to "just endure."

We cannot rely on the overused belief that "we are resilient".

At the end of the day, one thing is more likely than anything else: whatever you are going through right now, others are also experiencing something similar or much much worse.

I hope that, whatever our circumstance we are in, this also moves us to think about others.
