The week started productive but my stomach acted up on Thursday, and that disrupted my sleep (I was in the toilet 2AM to 3AM) ðŸ˜… This made it hard for me to think and work last Friday so I had to take a sick leave.<!--more-->

I could easily blame being sick for my generally feeling down, but I realized that also I worried a lot recently.

The situation in the Philippines causes a lot of uncertainty.

Nevertheless, I don't think it is beyond hope. For me, this means planning for a more stable future someday (maybe more details about this in another blog)

But for now I will start focusing on my active projects, including helping out some devs who are working on [VotePilipinas.com](https://votepilipinas.com/) - which is the official voter registration information campaign of the Commission on Election here in the Philippines.

Hopefully having a more educated population will raise up better leaders soon.
