Last night was a productivity game-changer. In the middle of a short break from work, I’ve had the time and headspace to zoom out. I decided that the best thing to do is dedicate some serious time to reassess my Weekly Review habit.

I am thankful for getting this chance any time I can. I often advise others (during one-on-ones, performance reviews, and casual catch ups) that when we get busy on the day-to-day grind, it is easy to forget where it all fits in the bigger picture. It’s always good to check where we are and get confidence that things are still in the right direction.

Now, with a fresh perspective, I updated my checklists and revisited the core principles behind the Weekly Review habit. And you know what? I’m genuinely excited to dive back in and do it right this time.

I stumbled upon a few missteps I’d been making. For one, I realized I was spending way too much time on the reviews, unnecessarily putting effort into too much detail. As a result, I’ve transformed them into a monotonous chore rather than a productive exercise. I was getting bogged down in robotic checks and losing sight of the bigger picture—the connection between my weekly tasks and my larger goals.

With this exercise, it became clear that I needed to inject flexibility and spontaneity into the process: make it FUN. It shouldn’t be about ticking boxes mindlessly; it should be about reflecting on the past week and strategizing for the next. Now I’m genuinely ready and excited to do my next Weekly Review!
