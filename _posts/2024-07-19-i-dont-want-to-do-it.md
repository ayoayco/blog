Most of the breakthroughs I’ve seen in my life were from things I didn’t want to do, and yet I made myself do them. At times the reward comes right after, other times they don’t. But they accumulate and now have built up a tolerance for doing things I don’t want to do. So now I get motivation not just because I initially wanted to do things, but also because there’s fulfillment in the simple achievement of getting things done. It’s like a game where I constantly beat the version of myself that don’t want to do things.
