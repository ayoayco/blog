description: Guitar solo idea for a song I wrote (Scared)
---

There's a bunch of music posted in my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/ayoayco/) and I'm looking to put everything here at some point.

I believe personal blogs should be the most complete collection of all your "stuff" online.

However, I am still looking for a good alternative to SoundCloud which I could self-host... possibly [funkwhale.audio](https://funkwhale.audio/) but I have to spend some time on checking the requirements first.

In the mean time, here's a guitar solo idea for a song I wrote (Scared):
