Counting myself as a “creative”, I gravitate toward looking for ways to reflect some Truth/Reality in different forms. One such form is by capturing moments in Photos.

At one point during a trip to Heidelberg, Germany I struggled to capture the old bridge without noise (tourists, unsatisfactory lighting/angle, etc.) Just in time, Apple released [Clean Up feature on their Photos app](https://cozy.pub/?url=https://appleinsider.com/inside/ios-18/tips/how-to-use-clean-up-in-ios-181-photos-to-remove-distractions), so I tested it... and it works! Locally too, meaning it does not need communication to some supercomputer via the Internet. 

It works like magic, and it’s clear that technology has come a long way for photography, but...

Why do I take photos? If I wanted a perfect shot, someone (a better photographer with better talent & tools) must have posted one online and I can just download their work — a joke I told my wife. 

So here are some reasons I take photos:
1. **Authenticity** - Capturing reality and reflecting truth is at the core of photography. Each shot is a snippet of a moment that can never be replicated. This means embracing the imperfections and unexpected elements that tell a story.

2. **Connection** - The photos I take carry memories that are personal to me. Each image is a timestamp of an experience, a place, and a feeling. These are the nuances that make the photo special and irreplaceable.

3. **Creativity** - From a young age, my father taught me the basics of photography which still guide every photo I take. Photography, for me, is a creative expression. It's about seeing the world through a unique lens, interpreting it, and sharing that with others.

The reality captured in a candid moment, the story behind an image, and the personal connection a photographer brings to each shot are irreplaceable. No matter what kind of Technological advancement for photography happens, these reasons will not change.
