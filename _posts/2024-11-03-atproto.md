My attempt to explain [AT Protocol](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/atproto) to a 5y.o. ‚Äî confirmed as [‚Äúlooks correct‚Äù](https://bsky.app/profile/danabra.mov/post/3la34iwphxk2i) by [dan](https://bsky.app/profile/danabra.mov). üòÖ

Personal Data Servers (PDS) are for common folk. Very lightweight, easy to set up. You own your stuff.

The big-world central Bluesky app / aggregator is for those that has the resource to run them: infra, moderation, manpower.

Maybe think of how Google search can pull public info from different sites and you can interact with them...

At some point other big-world aggregators can pop up (Bing, DuckDuckGo?) and we would probably need them

Currently PDSes by themselves don‚Äôt give us a way to interact, we need such big-world aggregators for that

Hence, the difficulty of seeing this network as a decentralized platform

That said, what they mean by it ‚Äútaking inspiration from The Web‚Äù ‚Äî is how Big Tech (in terms of resources) has owned the decentralized design of the Web via consolidation of information and controlling how we interact

Now the question is: what have we learned from that kind of Web?
