On the 1st of February 2025, I presented a project at [FOSDEM 2025](https://fosdem.org/2025/) [Social Web track](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/social-web/). I am very glad I got to participate in this one, as I have been passionately involved in the [fediverse](https://ayo.ayco.io/now/and-then/posts/2023-01-19) since I have joined in 2022.

I talked about [Elk](https://github.com/elk-zone/elk), which is is a nimble [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) client with great attention to user experience, boasting features such as being a Progressive Web App (PWA), support for code blocks with syntax highlighting, chronological threading, and markdown formatting.

In this talk, I gave a brief history of Elk development from the perspective of a contributor who has never written a Vue component (before Elk), some key features of the web application, and a look forward to the future of the project.
