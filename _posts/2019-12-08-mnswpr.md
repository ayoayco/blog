description: The classic Minesweeper game, recreated for the browser
---

This is the classic game [Minesweeper](https://mnswpr.com) built with vanilla web technologies (i.e., no framework dependency).

See the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/ayoayco/mnswpr)

## What I have learned:

1. JS is awesome ✨
1. We don't always necessarily _need_ JS frameworks (or TS) ✨
1. Even subtle UI changes _can improve_ user gameplay experience ✨
1. There's more ways to break you're app than you are initially aware of ✨
1. Competition motivates users to use your app more ✨
1. Hash in bundled filenames help issues in browser caching (when shipping versions fast) ✨

**Technology Stack:**

- HTML, JS, and CSS
- Webpack for bundling
- Firebase for leader board store
- Netlify for hosting
