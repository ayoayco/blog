I love getting things done. I have two big time blocks per week on my calendar named “MVAs; resched, don’t cancel”

These are when I push forward the “Most Valuable Actions” from all action points I accumulate in all my interactions.

As the name implies, I cannot cancel these timeblocks. Sometimes a more urgent thing comes up and I have to move... but never cancel.

I do this because I love getting things done.

But there’s one thing I don’t sacrifice in the name of getting things done: DISCIPLINE.

At the end of the day, if one has to cheat, betray, go behind people’s backs, throw colleagues under the bus, manipulate, lie, and all sorts of dirty tricks... regardless of whether an action / project / goal was successful... it is all for nothing.

It is a negative for the long-term.

It sets a bad example if you consider yourself a leader.

It ruins the collaborative spirit if you care about improving collaboration between groups.

It does not inspire confidence.

So remember every time to make a choice: Done or Discipline?
