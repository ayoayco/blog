Started organizing my photos & videos I have taken through the years, and here‚Äôs my planned method...

First up, I back up all raw files into separate directories per year in hard drives ‚Äî I currently have two: a 128GB USB-C, which I can plug directly into my phone on the go, and a 2TB external hard drive for less-frequent accessed backups. This way, I am confident that I have copies of everything safely stored even if cloud services get nuked for some reason. 

I will then curate and handpick my favorite items for significant moments (e.g., travels, events, parties), and create albums for them. These are the memories that matter to me; the ones I‚Äôd likely want to come back to and remember. Doing this reminds me of those family photo albums we used to keep around growing up.

These special albums are what I will then sync across devices using a cloud service. I use iCloud Photos (for now).

The idea is to be more intentional with the photos & videos I intend to keep close and share to friends & family.

So, that‚Äôs my plan: back up, sort, and organize. It‚Äôs a bit of work upfront, but in the end, it‚Äôs worth it.

Feel free to use this approach if your photo library could use a bit of intentional organization. Cheers! üçª
