Last month I gave a full hour of talk about [Astro](https://astro.build) and Micro-Frontends in the very first [Planon Software Development Meetup](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/planon_softwaredevelopment-developmentmeetup-microfrontend-activity-7159166634534846465-UXBu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).

We talked about Astro's Islands architecture and how to combine it with new web technologies such as EcmaScript Modules, Import Maps, and Smart CDNs that allow a simple client-side composition of independently developed and deployed Micro-Frontends.

Exciting times!
