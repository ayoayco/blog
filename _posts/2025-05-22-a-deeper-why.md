Let’s be honest. “Why” is an easy question to answer, and this is _why_ people don’t like talking about it... it feels silly to even ask. Because “Why” is just common sense most of the time.

Of course, we have to sell the stuff... We need money.

Of course, we need to go through the training… It’s mandatory.

Of course, I have to hang the laundry… My wife told me. Okay that last one is a bit personal (and fresh in my memory) but I need a third example, so there you go.

So is it a waste of time to bother with “Why”?

## The first Why is a trap

The easiest answer to “Why” is usually our common instinct. We all think of it. It doesn’t differentiate you from any other group who is looking at the same problem. When you stick with the first Why, it doesn’t inspire, or motivate… not even yourself.

The danger of leaving Why to its first iteration is that it will not carry you far. At the first challenge, it gets blown away.

We have enough money… why bother sell the stuff?

No body complained last time… why should I do it?

My wife is probably gonna do it later… why can’t I skip hanging the laundry?

The first Why is easy. The first Why is a trap.

## Iterate on the Why

So, go a bit further… ask it again. Like, Why do you really really really have to do it?

Why would your super hero do it?

What’s the Why that will make you get back up when your attempts fail?

We will sell these stuff… because it is good for our image (iterate!) — no, because it will help elevate people’s lives.

We need to do this training… because we kinda suck, and we don’t want to suck (iterate!) — because we will be better at our jobs and go home fulfilled and happier!

I have to hang the clothes… because they’re my clothes anyway (iterate!) — because it gives my wife some time to rest (iterate!) — no, because taking care of the family is a shared responsibility and I have to set an example for my kid.

I think the exercise can feel silly, and it takes some humility because you have to admit the first few answers are not good enough… but worth it in the end.

elevate people’s lives

go home fulfilled and happier

set an example for my kid

Now those are good Why’s.
