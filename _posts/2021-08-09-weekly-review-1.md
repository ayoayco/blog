Every Monday I start my work by reviewing the current state of my projects, the past week's progress, and my plans for the coming days. This is my *Weekly Review*. After my weekly reviews, I end up with journal entries that might not really be very well-thought-of in terms of style or grammar (usually they are just bullet points of realizations and ideas) and could be a bit personal, but I decided to share parts of them here in my blog starting today.<!--more-->

Here's my first entry in what I am hoping to be a series of weekly short blog posts.

-----

As the week starts, I need to be reminded to do things right by sticking to my productivity system (more details on this later).

One other new thing this week is that I have subscribed to various email newsletters from established news outlets. I want to be intentional in the information I consume from the web. I feel like scrolling down the rabbit hole of social media is putting my thoughts and mental health into the hands of strangers.

Reading the newsletters inspire me to start writing again. So here I am. Maybe I'll start with a weekly short blog.

Surprisingly this is also in my scheduled tasks for the day: post a new short blog. These kind of tasks often come from ideas I capture in my system (MORE ON THIS LATER haha).

Now I think about the Gospel--maybe because I have also been reading more Scripture and commentaries, with which by the way, I find Ligonier ministries (by RC Sproul et. al) so helpful. First, I think about the wonders of Christ's work on the cross. The Bible says he died for us when we were still unbelieving sinners (a picture of how he expects us to love even our enemies as well). What assurance this brings to us: that the salvation God offers doesn't depend on our works.

Yet still, doubt sometimes find its way into my mind, that this has become a constant prayer for me: that God help me overcome my unbelief.

I also pray for focus. My current jobs are relatively less intense the past week, but experience has shown me that this kind of "peace" doesn't last long. I need to get as much tasks out of the way so that when the busy days ambush me I wouldn't be thrown off.

The lockdown in our city due to the Pandemic has begun as well. I stocked up on supplies that I estimate could last for at least two weeks. Though my eating habits and sleeping habits still need improvement. As I write this (12:26 PM) I haven't had anything yet but coffee.

I still slept late last night due to *Monday anxieties*, which I need to address sooner. In my mind, I know that I need to fully trust Godâ€¦ and this should translate to being able to let go and fully rest on Sunday nights. It feels like taking a dive and closing my eyes and waking up on the swimming pool full of tasks for the week. I need to learn to trust God and let go.
