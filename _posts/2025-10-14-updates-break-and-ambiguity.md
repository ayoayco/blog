Okay, updates.

I am on a break, for months already, not thinking about the usual web technology problems, because my doctors think I need full rest.

I exercise regularly, almost everyday, and my wife constantly reminds me how I look so different now — maybe I can finally switch careers to modelling (kidding). I also play more guitar.

Funny enough, the challenge for me is how to not have goals. Just play, just recover. However I politely told my doctor that I don't see it as recovery (i.e., "going back") but more like getting through, moving forward, and taking lessons I pick up along the way. That is me accepting that there really is no going back. But I'm certain now I will come through stronger and a little bit wiser.

Technology is a life-saver. I track my heart rate, sleep, and activities. I use Large Language Models for mundane mental tasks like [private+secure translations](https://git.ayo.run/ayo/scripts/src/branch/main/ai-translate.sh) and [text-to-speech](https://git.ayo.run/ayo/simple-tts) — which, to me, is an important part of my journey.

As what felt like a matter of survival, I dived into [python & deep learning applications](https://ayo.ayco.io/threads/115090396384901152), [networking, security](https://social.ayco.io/@ayo/115017059188609732), and [hardware stuff](https://social.ayco.io/@ayo/115312327860543421).

I understood architectures on how users can be protected; accelerators for what is now, undeniably, a start of new kinds of computing; the ambiguity of how a huge pile of technologies are collectively being called "AI", how to avoid threats, and how to find value.

One important lesson I can share now is this... It's a crazy world out there, and I think the greatest threat is losing touch of reality. With most of our work & life now digitized and AI systems becoming increasingly good at "generating" stuff, malicious people will take advantage by creating bubbles of reality that serve their purposes.

Ambiguity is an enemy that gets used to manipulate people; and we cannot be complicit. Double check. Pay attention. Read between the lines.

**All** bubbles are meant to burst.
