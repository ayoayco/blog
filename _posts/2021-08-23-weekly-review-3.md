description: I continue to learn how to handle stress.
---

This is the start of the dreaded busy week. I am basically working on a web app/platform that needs to support two hackathons (one for manila and one for India). This week is highly likely to be a stressful week.<!--more-->

Fortunately the whole week leading to this I have been thinking and reading about stress management.

I started by noting my common stress triggers.

This brought some ideas on improvements I need to do regarding my habits, like:
1. **Praying unceasingly.** I got to be present in the moment and always laying my worries and anxieties to God.
2. **Being kind to myself.** I will do my very best to keep the events running behind the scenes, but acknowledge that I have limits and at the end of the day I will rest and put my mind at ease.
3. **Finding time for myself.** I will not neglect taking care of myself, and always condition my mind by reading books, playing guitar, playing games, and/or Spending time with my family.
4. **Observing discipline in my habits.** In my eating, sleep, and hygiene.

I also try to remind myself: "Everything works for the good"
