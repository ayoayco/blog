<span class="first-letter">I</span>t's kind of getting old, I know.

A new blog... *again?* What's this all about?

Well, to put it simply, **Full Hacker** is like [Life Hacker](https://lifehacker.com), but for developers (and other IT professionals). This will be a place to share "Life Hacks" that we want to share to one another... like automation, new tech, tools, setups, and all sorts of time-saving tips and tricks. <!--more-->

Let me just clear this one thing upfront: This is not a place to ask coding questions. We got [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) for that already. Instead, here, we just share secrets that make our work and life easier as developers.

Contributing is simple. Just hit us up with an email here: [FullHackerBlog@gmail.com](mailto:fullhackerblog@gmail.com) or head over to our place at [Github](https://github.com/fullhacker/fullhacker.github.io) and check the [Issues Page](https://github.com/fullhacker/fullhacker.github.io/issues). There are still lots of work to do in building this site and everyone is welcome to join. :)
