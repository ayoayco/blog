First things first. Before I write any blog at all, I want to take this time to talk about YOU GUYS! --the people for whom I will be writing and the shared purpose we are going to have here in Full Hacker.

You may be asking, "is this really going to be helpful for me?"

Well, that's exactly what this post is going to answer for you. <!--more-->

There is going to be a wide range of topics posted here in Full Hacker, but you will probably find them most helpful if:
1. ***You have an itching desire to hack technologies together and build something great.*** Full Hacker will provide you a steady stream of hand-picked and latest technologies. Be it for your passion projects or something you have to do for work or school, you'll be sure to find something new here every once in a while.
2. ***You have some interest in how the Web works.*** Vulnerabilities, SEO, new Web standards... these are things you most probably should stay informed about, and the Full Hacker blog has got you covered. In fact, I am working on a tool that intelligently crawls and analyzes websites to generate intensive reports on these areas. Of course, I will launch it here.
3. ***You have great curiosity to take a peek into other people's projects and their line of thinking.*** We will feature interesting projects from all over the Web. The Full Hacker blog will also release practical, step-by-step guides into how you and anyone from beginner to advanced can start into various technologies. The guides will come complete with the base code and/or licensed software that you will be needing so that you can focus on building instead of scrambling away into the Web for tutorials. 

Want to get notified when these tools and guides come out? Stay in touch with me and <a href="https://github.us17.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=85102052c447ce8a8bba06f24&id=2366f7f35a" target="_blank">sign up now</a>, so I can make sure you get an early access to all the Full Hacker products in the future.

At times you may find me seemingly talking to developers directly (because I am one), but I assure you this blog is not exclusively for developers.

This blog is for YOU if you have a heart for innovation and you want to use technology to solve real-world problems... or just have fun!

As I always say, "Make it Functional, but also make it Fun."

Here in Full Hacker, we will definitely have both.

In my next post, I am going to tackle one of the most asked questions by businessmen who wants to put up a website for their businesses, beginners in Web development and students who just want to see their work live online:

"Where can I host my website for FREE?"

I'll give you the BEST solution that will not only allow you to host a website for free but will also jumpstart your journey into building a great web development portfolio.

See You!
