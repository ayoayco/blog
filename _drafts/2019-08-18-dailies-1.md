Started working on a productivity app that fits how I see tasks that build habits (i.e., repetitive and quantifiable)

Here I write the process and considerations I have when choosing the technologies I used.<!--more-->

For the backend, aside from database and API, I want to build a smart engine that is able to understand the input from the user and present options depending on it. (i.e., add a location, reminders, timers, etc.)
