I have been thinking about how anxiety greatly affects productivity. When much of the coming days is a blur, it is easy to feel constricted.<!--more-->

Then when suddenly I have something to move things forward… to "get the ball rolling" … I instantly feel happy and productive.

But should this always be the case? I ask myself.

Despite difficulty I try to have a way of working when some things can't seem to move forward.

I remind myself that there are always other things I can direct my focus onto.

Another important thing, I realize, is acknowledging when it is indeed a time to rest.

It's not very easy when you get a sense of fulfillment in accomplishing things, and it takes humility and courage to say that the world won't end if I take my rest.

I find having time to step back allows me to approach problems with fresh eyes, and this is always good.
