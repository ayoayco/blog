Have you ever clicked a link to an article, all hyped up to read the content, only to be slapped in the face with popups over popups of requests to subscribe and consent permission?

Ah, well you're not alone.

A lot of websites now has become a "pay for convenience" kind of business.

Either you pay for literal money and get access to their content, or they make you jump through hoops and you pay with time (and your personal data).

And the hard truth is, website owners have every right to do this.

The more digital-literate people know several solutions exist to get around this.

You have browsers offering a Reader View.

You have apps like Pocket.

But are these solutions enough now?
