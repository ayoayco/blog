 1. Old-school technology is good
    1. A lot of thought into them
        1. marketing reasons (the world needed convincing)
            - but now they could lower the quality to accommodate higher quantity
        2. lack of tooling meant each part required more thought
            - but now that the parts and how to make them are figured out a lot of reuse happen and manufacturers could think "not our problem"
            - makes things faster to make
    2. Now though we have accepted some old tech are good, they are offered at higher prices
