# Frontend Lessons from a Decade of Angular 

Now that the world have had more than a decade of using Angular, there are some lessons we could extract from this opinionated framework that will help us not just in building Angular applications or libraries, but in the larger Frontend development world in general.

To be outright clear, this is not going to be a love letter to Angular or a nice trip down memory lane. I'm going to find a balance between the good and the bad, and ask, what can we take with us as we go ahead in the next ten years. 

Angular 1.0.0 officially came out on June 13th of 2012. Initially named AngularJS, [it took the world by storm]. 

It was a time when decoupled architecture was not yet a popular thing, and we did everything on the server including rendering full pages. 

I remember first hearing the words "all the business logic is in the browser" and go "what is this guy talking about?" 

Since then, Web Development has also grown in its capabilities.
