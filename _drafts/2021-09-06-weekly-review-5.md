The past week turned out great. My sleep has been awesome and I've been waking up early yet well-rested.<!--more-->

The anxieties and sickness from the previous week are totally fixed as if they didn't even happen. :)

Today, though, I realized I want to start the day even earlier to have time for more reading before work and other duties fight for my attention.

I don't think it would be that hard, but I'll take it a step at a time.

Jen and I started walking as an exercise dailyâ€¦ which does not only benefit our health but also gives us more time to talk about visions we have for our small family.

I enjoy these little walks.

Also! I have bought myself a Kindle Paperwhite. I'm so excited. :)

I've been reading more, and having this distraction-free, dedicated device will definitely result to more books enjoyed.

Not to mention, it is also better on the eyes especially when I only have time to read during bedtime. :)
