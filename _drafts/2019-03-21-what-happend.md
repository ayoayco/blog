Sooooo. I started this blog, because I wanted to have a place to record my journey into learning new Technologies; primarily related to the Web.

But months went by and I stopped/slowed down in this journey. It turned out, it is not something that excites me as much as it did when I was a bit younger. <!--more-->

Now I'm here thinking, *so what am I gonna do with this now?*

In all honesty, I still don't know. The only thing I'm sure of right now is that my passion for learning and growth in general is still here. In what, specifically, is something I still have to find out.

I guess we'll all just see.
