This is the second post in what I call my Weekly Reviews, where I share some parts of my journal entries for the week as well as thoughts or realizations I have along the way. These entries are not intended to be very well-thought-of in terms of style or grammar (usually they are just bullet points of realizations and ideas) and could be a bit personal, but I decided to share parts of them here in hopes that someone might find them useful.<!--more-->

## I basically had a stressful week.

<span class="first-letter">T</span>he week was more stressful to me than usual. I could physically feel the effects. I ate more junk food, and my sleep was more erratic. I dont blame anyone, though, but myself.

Also, aside from stress, there seems to be a danger in taking multiple projects: I have difficulty mastering a single whole project. Normally I would find it easy to know all the ins and outs of a project, but it gets harder as I get involved in more.

One other thing that I pondered on this week is this: that in a company, a lot of stress and frustrations could be prevented with good hiring processes. Leaders really need to learn that they can't just take in everyone. "More hands" doesn't always equal to "more efficiency". In fact, a couple of bad apples may cause the group more harm than help.

In line with this, I realized I need to learn to manage high stress days better. I can't always make sure that everyone in the team I join is "good", so I at least need to navigate these situations. I'm learning.

As the week ended I realized that stress also caused me to set aside healthy routines.

I know it sounds like I had a bad week... but these experiences lead to learning and, to me, that is always a good thing.

## As in anything, this affects my faith (for the better)

<span class="first-letter">B</span>eing a man of faith, I also realized how devastating it is to lose sight of God's Word. This makes me want to consume less "fruitless" media. I really need to take my discipline seriously, and entertainment must take only a small part of my life. The time I spend on entertainment I could now focus on mastering the Scripture, my personal growth, and relationships.

I also realized it is crucial to be disciplined in observing the time I go to bed and when I rise because this affects my day greatly. If I wake late I will only have time for work, and my time for important life things will be set aside.

## Now back to solving problems...

<span class="first-letter">W</span>hen Monday (today) came, I got a bit of the familiar anxiety, but it was manageable.

These Monday anxiety attacks need to be addressed, but in the meantime, I need to get back on my feet.

There are still many things I need to do. And I need to be excellent in everything.

One thing is certain: I am not getting any younger and we are not seeing any decline in world problems that need solving.
