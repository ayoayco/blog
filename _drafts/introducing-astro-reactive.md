# What is Astro and Why Does it Exist?

Earlier this year I had the urge to rewrite my personal website. It was written in Jekyll, a Static Site Generator (SSG) in Ruby, which I only picked up because I wanted to use Github Pages years ago, and I think it was the best SSG framework to deploy on it at the time. My experience with GH Pages was not good--maybe it was too early?--so I almost immediately moved to using Netlify, which was also relatively new but offered way better experience and control.

For a while, Jekyll was a good framework for my needs, especially partnered with Netlify. But several major versions and many different computers later, setting up the environment became a headache. Add to this the compatibility issues with the new M1 Mac--I just don't think the time it took to look for what's wrong was worth it. It would be faster to write everything in HTML.
