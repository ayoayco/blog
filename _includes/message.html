  <h2 style="font-weight: bold">Hello there, fellow human!</h2>
  <p>Welcome to my personal blog! Glad you are here.</p>
  <p>
    Like you, I have many areas of interest. And you will find here a collection
    of my posts on varying topics which are not confined to my "professional"
    work.
  </p>

  <div id="hidden-message-wrapper" style="display: none">
    <p>
      There may be some topics that pop up more than others.
      <a href="/technology">Technology</a> posts are mostly about web
      development, and may be more relatable to people who have found me for my
      development work. More opinionated <a href="/personal">personal</a> posts
      are where I talk about stuff I find interesting because of their potential
      to help others as much as they have helped me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I strive to keep things organized, and have created a page that lists
      <a href="/categories">all topics</a> I have covered so far. However, other
      topics are likely to be added in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for the interest in reading. I look forward to any feedback or
      even the possibility of collaboration. Hit me up about any topic you find
      here! Below are my contact details.
